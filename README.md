My very first website

A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this website, I am creating a tribute webpage of Late A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Sir using HTML and CSS.

Approach:

I will add an image of APJ Kalam at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. Inside that box, I have written a few of his achievements and details.
I will use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS, we will align and enhance overall design.

Approach:

In the element, I will give the title of the page using h1 tag after that we will add an image of him in the img tag with some caption. We will create another div tag and write all the contents (using p tags). I have also given ID for each tag so that we can beautify the design using respective-ID in the CSS file. In the CSS section, I have basically maintained a central design and used box-shadow to create box effect around the main content.
